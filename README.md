# Project Manas

Monolingual classical literary Tibetan modeling. The current focus is on pretrained transformer models for:

- Monolingual tasks that are useful for teaching to read Tibetan, especially word segmentation, part-of-speech tagging and named entity recognition.
- Use as an encoder for the machine translation model.
